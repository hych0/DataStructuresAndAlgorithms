# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms implemented using C++
This program utilizes singly linked list structure to implement stacks and queues. It reads in a text input and outputs the results from parsing and executing the commands in the text input.

Reading in the "commands1.txt" file, it gives an output file "output1.txt".
